        <h2>The Story Behind Sympax</h2>
        <p>The name Sympax was chosen to reflect the initiative's commitment to creating a peacefully coexistence among humans and artificial agents. Rooted in both philosophical and linguistic inspirations, it embodies our vision of a peaceful coexistence.</p>

            <p class="nameText">+</p>
            <p class="nameText">Pax</p>
        </div>
        <p>The word Sympax is derived from the biological term <strong>"Symbiosis"</strong> meaning "to live together," and <strong>"Pax"</strong> which means "peace" in Greek. Combined, it symbolizes a unified pursuit of peace.</p>

                "The Sympax Initiative was inspired by the growing discussions around the rights of nature and the citizenship granted to Sophia, the social robot. As artificial agents play a bigger role in our world, it's essential to create open, inclusive conversations that bring in a wide range of perspectives. Our goal is to make sure humans and artificial agents can live together peacefully, with mutual respect."
