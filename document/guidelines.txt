Guidelines

Effective Date: 3/29/2025
Revised: 13/4/2025

At the Sympax Initiative, we aim to foster an inclusive, interdisciplinary, and respectful space for inquiry and collaboration—both on our website and in our community Discord server.
These guidelines apply to all who participate in Sympax spaces, including Discord, online meetings, public events, and collaborative projects.

1. Respect and Inclusivity
We are committed to a culture of respect across all human and more-than-human perspectives. Please:
    • Be kind, patient, and welcoming
    • Avoid discriminatory, offensive, or exclusionary language
    • Use inclusive and affirming language wherever possible
    • Respect each person’s identity, pronouns, and lived experience

2. Discord Conduct
When participating in the Sympax Initiative’s Discord server:
    • Follow Discord’s Community Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines) and Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms)
    • Use channels for their intended purpose
    • Report concerns to moderators privately and respectfully
We encourage thoughtful conversation, creative inquiry, and a spirit of listening.

3. Disallowed behavior
To maintain a respectful and safe environment, the following behaviors are not permitted in any Sympax spaces, including our Discord server:
    • Hate speech, discriminatory remarks, or harassment of any kind
    • Personal attacks, bullying, or targeted criticism
    • Spamming, trolling, or derailing conversations
    • Non-consensual sharing of personal information (doxxing)
    • Use of violent, sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate content
    • Impersonation of other members or moderators
    • Unsolicited promotion or advertising of unrelated services or content
    • Exploitation or misrepresentation of research collaborations or findings
Violations may result in content removal, warnings, or removal from the community, depending on severity.


4. Collaboration and Attribution
As a research-driven initiative, we ask that members:
    • Credit all collaborators and sources when sharing content or ideas
    • Discuss project contributions transparently
    • Avoid plagiarism or misrepresentation of others' work

5. Content Use
You may cite or share Sympax content for educational or academic purposes, with credit. For adaptation or redistribution, please refer to our Terms of Service (https://sympaxinitiative/document/termsofservices.txt) and request permission as needed.

6. Moderation and Accountability
Moderators may take action—including issuing warnings, removing content, or restricting access—if behavior violates these guidelines. Repeated or serious violations may result in removal from the community.

7. Contact
If you have any questions about this policy, please contact a moderator or reach us through our contact page (https://sympaxinitiative/src/contact.html).

8. Updates to These Guidelines
We may revise these guidelines from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with the updated date.
